# Guess-the-number-game

PROGRAM DESCRIPTION 
In this project, you have to write a C++ program to design a game that involves guessing a number between two randomly generated numbers. You cannot see the randomly generated at start. If you guess correctly, you earn points. If you guess incorrectly, you lose points. You can keep on guessing as long as you have points remaining. You can also choose to display one of the two numbers (either the lower bound or the upper bound) to make the game easier. If you choose to display a number to get help, you earn less points for correct guesses and lose more points for incorrect guesses. You CANNOT, of course, display both bounds. If you COULD display both, there will be no guessing. 

DO NOT USE ARRAYS AND PROGRAMMER DEFINED FUNCTIONS IN YOUR PROGRAM. IF YOU DO SO, YOU WILL GET A ZERO. WE WILL LEARN ABOUT THOSE IN CHAPTERS 5 AND 6 LATER. 
Note that a player can cheat in this game by repeatedly entering a correct guess. But we will ignore that scenario for this project.
